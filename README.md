The colored circles are not moving in a circle. 
All of them are actually moving in a line. 

The colored circles are simply the position of a hidden outer circle projected onto the line they are on!

Play around with the sliders and buttons, and observe the movements of the circle, and appreciate the beauty of trigonometry :3
